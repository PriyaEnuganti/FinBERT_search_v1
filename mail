Dear [Product Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about the availability of an installable version of SearchBlox for the development environment within our Retail team. My goal is to create a simulation of search functionality, allowing us to assess and validate the improvements made to various fields such as title, meta data description, keywords, and URLs.

If an installable version of SearchBlox is available, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in guiding me through the installation process on my local machine. This would enable me to set up a dedicated environment for testing and analyzing the impact of specific changes made to the aforementioned fields. By comparing the search results before and after implementing these modifications, we can effectively assess the improvements brought about by the changes.

However, if an installable version is not accessible, I would like to inquire if there is a development or test beta repository that I can access instead. Having access to such a repository would allow me to point to a different index containing the new changes we wish to evaluate. This way, we can still compare the search results before and after the alterations to measure the effectiveness of our modifications and assess any potential improvements.

Your guidance and support in this matter would be highly appreciated. If you have any further suggestions or recommendations on alternative approaches to achieving this goal, please feel free to share them with me. I am eager to contribute to the enhancement of our search capabilities and look forward to collaborating with you on this endeavor.

Thank you for your time and attention. I am at your disposal for any additional information or assistance you may require.

Kind regards,
