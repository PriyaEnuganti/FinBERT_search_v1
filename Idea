Introduction:

Goal: Improve search results by optimizing search terms and associated metadata.
Approach: Utilize Elasticsearch simulation to analyze search data and make targeted changes.
Data Overview:

Search Terms: List of keywords used by users for search.
Occurrences: Number of times each search term appeared in search logs.
Visits: Number of times users clicked on search results for each term.
Identifying Low Occurrence-to-Visit Ratio:

Occurrence-to-Visit Ratio: Calculate the ratio for each search term (Occurrences / Visits).
Objective: Select searches with the least occurrence-to-visit ratio for optimization.
Proposed Changes:

Keywords: Modify low-performing search terms to be more relevant or popular.
Metadata Description: Enhance metadata descriptions for better keyword coverage.
Title: Optimize search result titles for increased click-through rates.
Implementation:

Update Data: Apply the proposed changes to the search terms, metadata, and titles.
Re-index Elasticsearch: Re-index the modified data for accurate simulation results.
Evaluation:

Before vs. After: Compare search results before and after the changes.
Metrics: Assess improvements in search relevance, click-through rates, and user satisfaction.
Benefits:

Enhanced Search Experience: Users find more relevant results, leading to increased engagement.
Improved Conversion: Better search results drive higher conversion rates.
Continuous Optimization: Regularly analyze data and make iterative changes for ongoing improvement.
