Preprocessing the data: The first step is to preprocess the data. The documents and user queries need to be cleaned and tokenized before feeding them into the model. You may also need to apply some specific preprocessing steps depending on the nature of the data.

FinBERT model: Load the pre-trained FinBERT model and fine-tune it on a relevant financial corpus. This is done by feeding the financial documents into the model and allowing it to update its parameters based on the financial vocabulary and syntax. This step will ensure that the embeddings generated by the model are tailored for the financial domain.

Two-tower architecture: The two-tower architecture consists of two identical models with shared weights. Each tower represents a document or query respectively. In this case, we will use the same FinBERT model for both towers. The model will take in the input text and output the embedding representation of that text.

Loss function: Once the embeddings have been generated, a loss function is used to compare the similarity of the embeddings between the query and documents. The cosine similarity is commonly used as the loss function in this type of architecture.

Training: The model is then trained on a dataset of queries and relevant documents. During training, the model learns to generate embeddings that are similar for relevant documents and queries and dissimilar for irrelevant documents and queries.

Inference: Once the model has been trained, it can be used for inference. Given a user query, the model generates an embedding representation of the query. The model then computes the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embedding representations of all the documents in the corpus. The documents with the highest cosine similarity scores are returned as the top matches.

Overall, this approach allows you to leverage the power of FinBERT for financial domain-specific document retrieval while also tailoring the embeddings for your specific use case using the two-tower architecture.
